# Neural Network
A feedforward neural network using backpropagation for image recognition. This was my Diploma Project for Upper Secondary School in 2021. The project was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi "3Blue1Brown") video series.

## Unity
The project was made in an old version of Unity but was later succesfully opened and built in editor version `2021.3.14f1` with no changes required.
